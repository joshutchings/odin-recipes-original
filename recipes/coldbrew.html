        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Cold brew is simply coffee that has been brewed with cold rather 
            than hot water and usually involves a long steeping processâ€”anywhere 
            between 12-24 hours. In terms of flavor, cold brew is generally 
            characterized as smooth, low-acid, and heavier than its hot brewed counterparts.</p>
