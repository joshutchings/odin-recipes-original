        <h1>Caffe Breve</h1>
       
            <p>Breve coffee, aka cafe breve or breve latte, 
            is a drink of equal parts espresso and half and half. 
            It's an Americanized version of the Italian latte that's 
            even richer and creamier. It's closest in definition to the 
            Cortado, a drink of Spanish origin that's made with espresso and whole milk.</p>
