        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in 
            Austria with later development taking place in Italy, and is 
            prepared with steamed milk foam. Variations of the drink involve 
            the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes 
            and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.</p>
